##    PKG_LIBS=`${R_HOME}/bin/Rscript -e "Rcpp:::LdFlags()"`
## 
##    sed -e "s|@PKG_LIBS@|${PKG_LIBS}|" \

## 
## which together with the following file 'src/Makevars.in'
##
##    PKG_LIBS = @PKG_LIBS@
##
## can be used to create src/Makevars dynamically. This scheme is more
## powerful and can be expanded to also check for and link with other
## libraries.  It should be complemented by a file 'cleanup'
##
##    rm src/Makevars
##
## which removes the autogenerated file src/Makevars. 
##
## Of course, autoconf can also be used to write configure files. This is
## done by a number of packages, but recommended only for more advanced users
## comfortable with autoconf and its related tools.
